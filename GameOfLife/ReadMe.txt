Trying to get "Conway's Game of Life" working on the console.
Comments are a mix of:
	documentation ripped from the web,
	psuedo-code outlining,
	notes to myself,
	and some brainstorming 
Really just a spaghetti code mess. Needs loads of clean-up.

Found some stuff about using the mouse with the console, maybe we can get that working.
Until that is up and running, need to get some pre-gen seed patterns.
But before either of those happen, just get a random pattern working.
Until then, enumSeeds.cs and ConsoleListener.cs are unused.

very basic rough draft version is working. needs to be refined more.
